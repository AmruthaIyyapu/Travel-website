          <h2>Why Boston?</h2>
          <h3>The perfect gateway to New England and East coast</h3>
          <p>
            Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in America, founded on
            the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English
            town of the same name.It was the scene of several key events of the
            American Revolution and the nation's founding, such as the Boston
            Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the
            siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Great Britain, the
            city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well
            as a center for education and culture.The city has expanded beyond
            the original peninsula through land reclamation and municipal
            annexation. Its rich history attracts many tourists, with Faneuil
            Hall alone drawing more than 20 million visitors per year.Boston's
            many firsts include the United States' first public park (Boston
            Common, 1634), first public or state school (Boston Latin School,
            1635)first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897), and first
            large public library (Boston Public Library, 1848).

            innovation and entrepreneurship, with nearly 5,000 startups.Boston's
            economic base also includes finance,professional and business
            services, biotechnology, information technology, and government
            activities.Households in the city claim the highest average rate of
            philanthropy in the United States. Boston businesses and
            institutions rank among the top in the country for environmental
            sustainability and new investment.
